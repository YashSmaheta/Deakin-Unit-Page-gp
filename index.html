    DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, 
    communication, and integration between software developers and IT operations professionals. 
    It aims to automate the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes, enabling organizations 
    to release software more frequently, reliably, and efficiently. By breaking down silos between development 
    and operations teams, DevOps fosters a culture of continuous improvement and rapid iteration, ultimately 
    driving greater business agility and customer satisfaction.
